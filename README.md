# Urban-Planning-ML-Clustering
This project implements a custom K-means clustering algorithm to identify and cluster urban centers from night-time satellite imagery. The algorithm processes 64x64 grayscale images to locate illuminated areas, representing cities, and calculates distances between these clusters.
